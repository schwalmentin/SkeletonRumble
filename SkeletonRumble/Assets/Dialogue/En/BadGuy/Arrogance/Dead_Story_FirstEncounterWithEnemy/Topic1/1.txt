I told you...
<W>I'm way too <R>strong<R> for you!

Give up, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
Now that you've <W>seen my <R>strength<W,R> you should <W>accept your <R>defeat<R>!

Better luck next time...
<W>If there is any!

<W,R>Oops<W,R>, I hope I didn't go too harsh on you...
<W>Well, now it's <R>too late<R>.

Goodbye, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>.
I'll build you a <Co=St7>Grave<RE> if you <W>promise to <R>stay dead<R>...
