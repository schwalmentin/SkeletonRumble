That's a nice <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> you got there <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
It seems to hit a bit <W,R>better<R> than mine!
<W>And I know it's <R>bold<R> to ask but <R>could I have<R> it?

<W>It seems one of my <Co=St9>Hammers<RE> <W>has seen its best days...
Hey, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
Do you want to <W,R>swap<R> yours against mine?

<Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
I like the <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> you're using!
<W,R>Hurts<R> like nothing else I have to say.
Could you see yourself turning it over <W>to my <R>personal collection<R>?

<W>That's a fine <R>gravure<W,R> on your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE>...
<W>Could I have a <R>closer look<R>?

You've got a fine <Co=St9>Hammer<RE>...
<W>May I try it out <R>on you<R>?
