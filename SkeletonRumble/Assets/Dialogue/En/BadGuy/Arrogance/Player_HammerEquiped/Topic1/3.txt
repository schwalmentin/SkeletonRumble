Okay, okay!
Asking doesn't hurt!
<W>I still kind of <R>want it<R>...

<W>You could have at least <R>considered<R> it...

<W>In that case I might as well just <R>take it<R> from you!

Come on, I wanted to get it <W>without having your <R>blood<R> all over it...
<W>Even if though you can't <R>bleed<R> anymore...

Is it the please?
No... <W>that can't be the problem...
Hand it over to me... <S,R>NOW<R>!
Better?
