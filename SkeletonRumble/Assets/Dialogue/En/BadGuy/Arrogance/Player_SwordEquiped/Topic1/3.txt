Could you <R>prove<R> it <W>without having to <R>harm<R> me?

It would be nice to <R>experience<R> it <W>without <Co=St6>Dying<RE> <W>in the process.

<W>Hold on!<W> Is there any <R>option<R> without getting <Co=St6>Killed<RE>?

To be honest, they all sound like they <R>hurt<R> a bit too much for my <R>taste<R>...
<W>Is it possible to <R>tone it down<R> a bit?

You sound like the biggest <R>sadist<R> I've ever met...
<W>Could you...<W> <TD=0.5,R>not<R> <Co=St6>Kill<RE> me... maybe?
