That's a <R>sharp<R> <Co=St9>Sword<RE> you've got there!
<W>Would you mind showing it to me?

I'm wondering whose <Co=St9>Sword<RE> is <R>sharper<R>.
<W>Mine or yours?

That's a nice <R>blade<R> you've got there, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
<W>I wonder how <R>sharp<R> it is?

That's a <R>pointy tip<R> and a <R>clean blade<R> you've got there.
<W>Do you mind showing its <R>sharpness<R> to me?

<W>That <Co=St9>Sword<RE> <W>looks just as <R>unpractical<R> as mine...
Would mind showing me if it's at least <R>sharp<R>?
