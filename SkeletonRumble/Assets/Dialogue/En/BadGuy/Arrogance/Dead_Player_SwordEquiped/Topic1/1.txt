Your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> definitively is sharp, but it <W>can't hold up with <R>my standards<R>...

The blade of your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> is <W>very <R>dull<R> compared to mine...
<W>A typical <R>waste product<R>.

I'm going to stick your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> into your <Co=St7>Grave<RE>.
<W>It's not like it <R>could be used<R>!

You have just proven that your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> is not enough to <Co=St6>Kill<RE> me.
<W>Therefor...<TD=0.3> I officially declare it as <R>garbage<R>!

To be honest it's a <W>little wonder<W> your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> isn't broken already since it is of a <W>rather <R>bad quality<R>.
<W>Well...<TD=0.3> what can you do...
