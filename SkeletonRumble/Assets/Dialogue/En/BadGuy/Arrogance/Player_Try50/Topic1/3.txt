<W>Talking about <R>stubbornness<R>...

Yes, but shouldn't you <R>rethink<R> your approach a bit, after you <W,R>failed<R> <Co=St3>50<RE> <W>times?

<Co=St3>50th<RE> time is the <R>charm<R>, <W>right?

<W>Look,<W> this is your <Co=St3>50th<RE> try and I <R>don't<R> appreciate you always coming back just to be <Co=St6>Killed<RE> again...

Even if it is the <Co=St3>50th<RE> try <W>nothing will <R>magically change<R> from before...
