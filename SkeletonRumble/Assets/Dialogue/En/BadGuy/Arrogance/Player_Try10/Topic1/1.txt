It has got to be <R>painful<R> every time you <Co=St6>Die<RE>.
So why do you <W>keep <R>coming back<R>?

Hey, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>...
<W>Isn't it <R>painful<R> to try?

Even though you are <R>dead<R> already, isn't it still <R>painful<R> to <Co=St6>Die<RE>?

<W>I admire your will to live and the <R>determination<R> in your <R>nonexistent heart<R>,<W> but it has got to <R>hurt<R>, doesn't it?

I would probably <W>suffer from a <R>trauma<W,R> if I were you...
