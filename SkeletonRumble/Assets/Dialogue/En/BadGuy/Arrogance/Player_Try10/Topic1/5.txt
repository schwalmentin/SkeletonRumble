I think I never wanted to <Co=St6>Kill<RE> you <W>as much as now!

I have never heard such a <R>dumb reason<R>!

<W>There goes my <R>hope<R> for you once again...

Now I'm certain!
You truly have lost your <R>brain<R> and <W,R>everything<R> that comes with it!

Do me a favor and <R>dig<R> yourself a <Co=St7>Grave<RE>...
<W>You'll need it!
