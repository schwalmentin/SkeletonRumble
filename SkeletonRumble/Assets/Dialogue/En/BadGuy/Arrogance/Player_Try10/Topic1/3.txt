I have no clue by what <W,R>ancient magic<R> you keep coming back without f<R>eeling<R> anything!

Is your <W>brain mentally <R>strong<R,W> or are you just <W>to <R>dumb<R> to feel anything?

I don't want to know what happened to you before all of this but considering your <R>willpower<R>, <W>it must have been <R>awful<R>!
<W,R>And I like that!

Are you something like a <W,R>demigod<R> of <Co=St6>Death<RE> or why do you <W>keep coming back as if nothing happened?

I think you <W>lost your <R>brain<R>, <R>nervous system<R>, <R>hearth<R> and everything else that has to do with <R>emotions<R>, <R>pain<R> and <R>suffering<R>.
<W>Why?
Because you're always coming back as if <R>nothing happened<R>...
