Your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> is <W>way too <R>blunt<R>!
How would you ever <W,R>crack<R> a <Co=St5>Skull<RE> with that?

Your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> looks really nice, but it <W,R>sadly<R> is absolutely <R>useless<R> as a <Co=St9>Weapon<RE>...

The balance is off, the head has seen its days and it seems like it's... <W>hollow inside...
How can you even <R>fight<R> with this <Co=St9>Hammer<RE>?

Your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> is a <W>wonderful piece of art<W> but it doesn't work as a <Co=St9>Weapon<RE>...
<W>Which is a <R>problem<W,R> since you should <Co=St6>Kill<RE> with it...

I'm sorry but you'll <W>never reach your <R>full potential<W,R> with this kind of <Co=St9>Weapon<RE>...
