Stop going easy on me by <W>not <R>fighting<R> properly!

You're <W>not even trying<W> to <Co=St8>Dodge<RE> my <R>attacks<R>!

Could you fight properly?
<W>This is <R>scraping my honor<R>!

You haven't <R>beaten<R> me once, so <W>why aren't you <R>fighting<R> properly?

<W>You're <R>horrible<R> for treating me like as if I were a <R>child<R>...
