<W,R,B>Ha!
<W>I <R>shut you down<W,R> before you could complete your new <W,Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>!
That's what you get for <W>not <R>concentrating<R> on our fight!

Stop chasing after <W,Co=St4>Highscores<RE> <W>in the middle of our <R>fights<R>!

And <W>another attempt<W> at <R>cracking<R> your <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE> <W>has been prevented!
Seriously, <W,R>focus<R> on our fight a bit more!

You <W>seriously attempted to <R>complete<R> a new <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>, didn't you?
<W,R>Too bad<R> I <Co=St6>Killed<RE> <W>you<W> before you could do it!

Since you're going for that <W>sweet, sweet <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>, I decided to <W,R>interfere<R> a bit.
<W,R>You're welcome!
