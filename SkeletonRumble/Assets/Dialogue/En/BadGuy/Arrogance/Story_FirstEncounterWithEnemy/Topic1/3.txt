Again?
<R>Seriously?
<W>When do you guys learn you can't <R>defeat<R> me?

Firstly, that's <R>not nice to do<R> and secondly <W>you can't <R>defeat<R> me anyway.

<W>How bold of you to ask!
Not that it matters since I am <W>way to <R>strong<R> for you...

Wow, you're <R>jumping<R> right to it... <W>not that it matters since I am way <R>stronger<R> than you anyway...

<W>I think <Co=St1>Little One<RE> <W>would be a great <R>name<R> for you...
You jump right to the point, probably have no <R>brain<R> and you're way <R>weaker<R> than me...
<W>It fits you <R>perfectly<R>!
