<W>You've got <R>guts<R> to say that!

<W>Bring it on so that I can <R>end your life<R> as fast as possible!

<W>I will <R>end your life<R> for this!

This is your last <R>warning<R>!
<W,R>Flee as far as you can<R> because I won't hold myself back any longer!

My <R>last words<R> have been set in stone for <W>many years now...
And yet nobody has ever had the joy of hearing them... <W>and this <R>won't change<R> for you!

You should never have come this far...
<W>I will <R>punish<R> you with <Co=St6>Death<RE>!
