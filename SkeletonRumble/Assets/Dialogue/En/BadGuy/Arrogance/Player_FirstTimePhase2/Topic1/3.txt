I should probably <W>start <R>fighting properly<R> now, shouldn't I?

In that case...
<W>Let's raise the <R>challenge<R> a bit...

Don't worry, <W>I'm not <R>mad<R>...
<W>I'm just going to make sure your next few <Co=St6>Deaths<RE> <W>will feel a bit more... <R>painful<R>!

As if I would be affected by your <W>endless barrage of words!

You will be the only one to <Co=St6>Die<RE> at this <W,R>miserable place<R>!

<W>Hah, do you really think I'm going to <R>end<R> this here?
No, your <R>life<R> will be the only thing that <W,R>ends<R> here!
