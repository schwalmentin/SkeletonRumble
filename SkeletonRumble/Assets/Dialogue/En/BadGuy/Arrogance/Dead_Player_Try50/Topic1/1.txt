<W,Co=St3>50 <Co=St7>Graves<RE> <W>and not a <R>single visitor<R> besides me<W> when I build your next one...
<W,R>How sad!

There is no better way than to <W,R>celebrate<R> your <Co=St3>Anniversary <Co=St6>Death<RE> <W>with a new <Co=St7>Grave<RE>...

Didn't I tell you that it's getting <R>ridiculous<R>?
<W>Because it is!

Do you think you can make it until our <W,Co=St3>100th Anniversary<RE>?
<W>Because I think you <R>won't<R>...

Even after <Co=St3>50<RE> tries you still don't get the <W,R>difference in strength<W,R> between us...
