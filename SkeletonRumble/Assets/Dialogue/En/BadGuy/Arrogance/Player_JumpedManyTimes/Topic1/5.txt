I think I <W,R>lost<R> my last shred of <R>hope<W,R> into you.

<W>Stop being so <R>annoying<R> please!

Don't worry, I don't think I was ever <W>as <R>disappointed<R> as now...

It's a <W,R>waste<R> of time to hope for you to become less <R>annoying<R>...

How about this.
I am going to <Co=St8>Jump<RE> as high as I can and then I'm going to <W,R>crush the ego<R> you've collected up there.
Sounds fair?
<W>Let's do it!
