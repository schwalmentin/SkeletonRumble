Oh my god, could you please stop <Co=St8>Jumping<RE>!
What are you?
<W>A <R>frog<R>?

Why are you <Co=St8>Jumping<RE> so often?
<W>Is there any tactical value to it?

I wonder if you <W>were still here<W> if you <Co=St6>Died<RE> as often as you <Co=St8>Jumped<RE>!

<W>So, you've <R>mutated<R> into a <R>spring<R> now, haven't you?

<W>Come on my little <R>grasshopper<R>.
<W>Let me <R>step on you<R>, to hear that excellent <R>crunching<R> sound of your <Co=St5>exoskeleton<RE>!
Stop <Co=St8>Jumping<RE> away, what are you fleeing from?
