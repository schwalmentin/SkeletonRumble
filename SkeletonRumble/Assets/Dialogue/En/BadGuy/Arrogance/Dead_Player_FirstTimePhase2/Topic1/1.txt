<W>Sorry<W>, but I had to <W>make <R>quick work<R> of you<W> to set an <W,R>example<W,R>!

Don't you want to <W>give up<W>, after you've seen my <W,R>full strength<W,R>?

It was quite refreshing <W>sending you to your <Co=St7>Grave<RE> with my <W,R>full strength<R>!

Now you should know of your <W>own <R>weakness<R>!
Give up already.
<W>You have <R>no chance<R>!

This is my <W,R>true strength<R>!
You should accept your defeat after you've been <W,R>crushed<R> this hard...
