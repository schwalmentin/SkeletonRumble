I'm sorry but could you stop coming back?
The <Co=St3>100th <Co=St7>Grave<RE> is last one I'm going to build...
<W>You're <R>ruining<R> the <R>beautiful landscape<R> with those <Co=St7>Graves<RE>...

<W>Stop!
I'm not going to build you any more <Co=St7>Graves<RE>...
<W>The <R>landscape is ruined<R>, and you don't seem like you have the <R>mental capacity<R> to know when you should <R>give up<R>...

I told you... <W>like so many times before,<W> my <R>advice was right<R>, and you <R>never cared<R>...
This means no more <Co=St7>Graves<RE> for you, <W,Co=St1>Little One<RE>!

<W>Well...
<W>I did warn you <R>multiple times<R>...
I'm going to build you one last <Co=St7>Grave<RE> now...
After that... <W>not even your <Co=St5>Bones<RE> <W>will <R>remain<R>!

You never learned...
I think I <W>finally lost my <R>hope<R> for you...
<W>I hold onto that for <R>way to long<R> anyway...
This will be the last <Co=St7>Grave<RE> I'm going to give you...
<W>You better stay <R>dead<R> now.
