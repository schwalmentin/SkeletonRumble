Even after trying <W>your <R>best<R> to <Co=St8>Parry<RE> everything <W>you <R>still failed<R>...
<W>What a <R>shame<R>...

Finally, I got some <W,R>good hits on you!
Your tendency to <Co=St8>Parry<RE> is <W>really <R>annoying<R>!

You seem to try to <Co=St8>Parry<RE> my attacks the whole time.
<W>Too bad your timing is <R>not the best<R>!

Stop <Co=St8>Parrying<RE> my attacks!
It's a fine <Co=St8>Skill<RE> but it is also <W>annoying as <R>hell<R>!

Stop <Co=St8>Parrying<RE>!
It doesn't fit into your fight style when you can't <W>reliably <R>defend yourself<R> with it!
