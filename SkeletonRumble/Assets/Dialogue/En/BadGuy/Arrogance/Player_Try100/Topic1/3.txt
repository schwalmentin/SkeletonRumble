<W>I can understand that.
But doesn't it... like... <R>hurt<R> to <Co=St6>Die<RE>?

Ok, ok!
But still, shouldn't this be at least... <W>a bit <R>worryful<R> to you?

Ok, I get it.
<W>You are one of the <R>extremely stubborn<R> ones,<W> but doesn't this take its <R>toll<R> on you?

Why am I more <R>worried<R> about you than you yourself?
<W>Do you even <R>care<R> about what's happening to you?

Even though you are <R>struggling<R> you're not <R>giving up<R>...
<W>Why?
<W>Why won't you take <R>care<R> of yourself?
