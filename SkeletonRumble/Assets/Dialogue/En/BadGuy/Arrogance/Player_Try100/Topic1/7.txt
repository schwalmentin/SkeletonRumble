I tried... I tried.
<W>Back to <R>teaching<R> you the <R>hard way<R> then!

<W>Ugh!
Why did I even bother <R>counting<R> if you won't listen...

Even when you say so...
I still <R>defeated<R> you a <Co=St3>100<RE> times!
<W>So, one more <R>fight<R> won't make a <R>difference<R>!

<W>Those who refuse to follow <R>rules<R> shall feel the <R>consequences<R>...

You're as calm as ever...
<W>Let's handle this with a good old <R>fight<R> then...
