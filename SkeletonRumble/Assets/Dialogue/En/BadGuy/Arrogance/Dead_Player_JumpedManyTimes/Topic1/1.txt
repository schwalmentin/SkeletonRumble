<W>Well...<TD=0.3> the <R>fall damage<R> seemed to do <R>the trick<R>...
<W>Rest in peace <R>little frog<R>!

Your <Co=St8>Jumping<RE> strategy didn't seem to help you either...
You should <W,R>rethink<R> your approach<W> a bit!

<Co=St8>Jumping<RE> really <W>drains your <R>internal stamina<W,R>, doesn't it?
And when you're getting tired, <W>you're bound to make <R>mistakes<R>!

If you could <W>fight as good as you jump<W> than I wouldn't have had <W>to <R>dig<R> all of those <Co=St7>Graves<RE> for you...

A small advice for you <Co=St1>Little One<RE>...
The air is a great place to <W,R>hinder<R> someone's attack capabilities!
It is also the place where you can <W,R>fall<R> the furthest...
Do with this as you please!
