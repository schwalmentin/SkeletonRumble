The air is definitely refreshing but <W>getting smacked through it<W> makes me want to <Co=St6>Kill<RE> you <W,R>really bad<W,R>!

If you keep smacking me through the air like that, then I'll crave for your <Co=St6>Death<RE> more than ever before.

<W>Could you stop pushing me through the <R>air<R>.
It hurts and I can't seem to escape it that easily!

<W>That was enough fresh air for me!
Would you be so kind to <R>stop<R> hurling me through the air?

Flying sure is nice but <W>the <R>pain<W,R> sadly holds this experience away from being enjoyable...
