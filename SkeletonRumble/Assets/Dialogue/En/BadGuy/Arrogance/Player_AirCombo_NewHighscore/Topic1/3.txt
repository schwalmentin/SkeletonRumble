This new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> of yours is... well at least a <W>little <R>higher<R> than before.

As if this already got to be your new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE>?
<W>Your last one must have been <R>really bad<R>...

<W>So, it has already been a new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE>?

Not bad, to be honest I didn't think that this <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> could be this high...
<W>As if I would ever say that!
<W>Too bad this <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> <W>is still <R>worth nothing<R>!

That's a pathetic little <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> you've got there.
<W>There is nothing you could be <R>proud<R> about!
