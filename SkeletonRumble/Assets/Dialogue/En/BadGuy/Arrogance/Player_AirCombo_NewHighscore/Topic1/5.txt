But maybe <W>use the <R>training dummy<R> to <R>crack<R> that <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> for the next time!

No matter how awesome your next super cool mega <Co=St4>Air Combo<RE> is going to be, <W>I don't want to be a <R>part of it!

<W>I already booked a <R>vacation flight<R> for when you finally decide to <R>give up<R>!

I'm looking forward to it!
<W,R>To <R>hinder<R> you in doing so that is...
