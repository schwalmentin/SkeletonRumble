Did you even <W>try to fight back <R>seriously<R>?

You've got what you <R>deserve<R> for <W>not taking this <R>seriously<R>!

I don't want to know what you wanted to achieve with this, but it <W>didn't seem to <R>work out<R> after all...

<W>Are you finally <R>giving up<R>?<RE> At least that's the only real explanation for your <W>lack in <R>initiative<R>...

If you just want to <Co=St6>Die<RE>, then at least do it somewhere were I don't have to <W>look into your <R>dead eyes<R>!
