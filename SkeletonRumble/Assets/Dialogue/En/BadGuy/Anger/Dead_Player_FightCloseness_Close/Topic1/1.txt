Phew!|That was a close one!
You were fighting better than ever!

That was a good fight!
Too bad you <B>didn't<B> make it in the end!

I was sweating in this fight!
Well, at least as much sweating as someone undead is able to!

Ouch!
It got to be closer than I would like but this was nothing more than a little slip up!

Just because it got a bit close <B>doesn't<B> mean you've suddenly got the upper hand, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
