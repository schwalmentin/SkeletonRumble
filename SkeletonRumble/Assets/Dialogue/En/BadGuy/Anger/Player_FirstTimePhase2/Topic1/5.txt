You've got guts to say <S=4>THAT<RE>!

Bring it on so that I can end your life as fast as possible!

I will <B>end<B> your life for this!

This is your LAST warning!
Flee as far as you can because I won't hold myself back any longer!

My last words have been set in stone for many years now...
And yet nobody has ever had the joy of hearing them... and this won't change for you!

You should never have come this far...
I will punish you with <Co=St6,B>Death<RE>!
