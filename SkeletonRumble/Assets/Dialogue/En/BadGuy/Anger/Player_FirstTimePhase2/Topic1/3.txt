I should probably start fighting properly now, shouldn't I?

In that case...
Let's raise the challenge a bit...

Don't worry, I'm not mad...
I'm just going to make sure your <B>next few <Co=St6>Deaths<RE> will feel a bit more... <B,S=2>painful<RE>!

As if I would be affected by your endless barrage of words!

You will be the only one to <Co=St6,B>Die<RE> at this miserable place!

Hah, do you really think I'm going to end this here?
<B>No<B>, your life will be the only thing that ends here!
