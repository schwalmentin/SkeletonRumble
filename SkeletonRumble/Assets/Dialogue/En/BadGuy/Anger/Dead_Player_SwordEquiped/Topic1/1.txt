Your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> definitively is sharp, but it <B>can't<B> hold up with my standards...

The blade of your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> is very DULL compared to mine...
A typical waste product.

I'm going to stick your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> into your <Co=St7>Grave<RE>.
It's <B>not<B> like it could be used.

You have just proven that your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> is not enough to <Co=St6,B>Kill<RE> me.
Therefor I officially declare it as garbage!

To be honest it's a little wonder your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> isn't broken already since it is of a rather bad quality.
Well, what can you do...
