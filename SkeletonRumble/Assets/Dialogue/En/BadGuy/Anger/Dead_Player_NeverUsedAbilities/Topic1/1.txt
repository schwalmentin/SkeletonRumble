Did you even try to fight back <B>seriously<B>?

You've got what you deserve for NOT taking this seriously!

I don't want to know what you wanted to achieve with this, but it didn't seem to work out well...

If you just want to <Co=St6,B>Die<RE>, then at least do it somewhere were I don't have to look into your dead eyes!
