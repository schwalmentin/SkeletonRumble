Even after trying your best to <Co=St8>Parry<RE> everything you still failed...
What a SHAME...

Finally, I got some good hits on you!
Your tendency to <Co=St8>Parry<RE> is really annoying!

You seem to try to <Co=St8>Parry<RE> my attacks the whole time.
Too bad your timing is <B>not<B> the best!

<S=2,B>Stop<RE> <Co=St8>Parrying<RE> my attacks!
It's a fine <Co=St8>Skill<RE> but it is also annoying as HELL!

<B>Stop<B> <Co=St8>Parrying<RE>!
It doesn't fit into your fight style when you can't reliably defend yourself with it!
