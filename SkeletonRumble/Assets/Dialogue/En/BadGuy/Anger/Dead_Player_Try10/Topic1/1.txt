You should be proficiently powered out now, so stop returning for ONCE...

Do you like the <Co=St7>Graves<RE>?
Because now you're getting your 10th one...

Aren't you tired of <Co=St6,B>Dying<RE> already?

You should know by now that you can't compete with me.
So, stop coming back ALREADY!

Stay dead for ONCE...
<B>Please<B>!
