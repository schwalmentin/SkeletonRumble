That's a nice <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> you got there <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
It seems to hit a bit better than mine!
And I know it's bold to ask but could I have it?

It seems one of my <Co=St9>Hammers<RE> has seen its best days...
Hey, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
Do you want to swap yours against mine?

<Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
I like the <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> you're using!
Hurts like <B>nothing else<B> I have to say.
Could you see yourself turning it over to my personal collection?

That's a fine gravure on your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE>...
Could I have a closer look?

You've got a fine <Co=St9>Hammer<RE>...
May I try it out?
