I have no clue by what ancient magic you keep coming back without feeling anything!

Is your brain mentally strong or are you just to DUMB to feel anything?

I don't want to know what happened to you before all of this but considering your willpower, it must have been awful!

Are you something like a demigod of <Co=St6>Death<RE> or why do you keep coming back as if nothing happened?

I think you <B>lost<> your brain, nervous system, hearth and everything else that has to do with emotions, pain and suffering.
Why?
Because you're always coming back as if NOTHING happened...
