It has got to be painful every time you <Co=St6>Die<RE>.
So why do you keep coming back?

Hey, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>...
Isn't it painful to try?

Even though you are <B>dead<B> already, isn't it still painful to <Co=St6,B>Die<RE>?

I admire your will to live and the determination in your nonexistent heart, but it has got to hurt, doesn't it?

I would probably suffer from a <B>trauma<B> if I were you...
