Sorry, but I had to make quick work of you to set an example!

Don't you want to give up, after you've seen my full strength?

It was quite refreshing sending you to your <Co=St7>Grave<RE> with my full strength!

Now you should know of your own <B>weakness<B>!
Give up already.
You have <B>NO<B> chance!

This is my TRUE strength!
You should <B>accept<B> your defeat after you've been crushed this hard...
