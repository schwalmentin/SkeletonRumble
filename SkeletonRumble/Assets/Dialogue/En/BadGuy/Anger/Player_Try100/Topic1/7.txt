I tried... I tried.
Back to teaching you the <B>hard<B> way then!

Ugh!
Why did I even bother counting if you <B>won't<B> listen...

Even when you say so...
I still defeated you a <Co=St3,B>100<RE> times!
So, one more fight WON'T make a difference!

Those who refuse to follow rules shall feel the <S>consequences<S>...

You're as calm as ever...
Let's handle this with a good old fight then...
