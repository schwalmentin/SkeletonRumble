AGAIN?
Seriously?
When do you guys learn you <B>can't<B> defeat me?

Firstly, that's not nice to do and secondly you <B>can't<B> defeat me anyway.

How BOLD of you to ask!
Not that it matters since I am way to strong for you...

Wow, you're jumping right to it... not that it matters since I am way stronger than you anyway...

I think <Co=St1>Little One<RE> would be a great name for you...
You jump right to the point, probably have <B>no<B> brain and you're way weaker than me...
It fits you perfectly!
