I <B>told<B> you...
I'm way too strong for you!

Give up, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
Now that you've seen my strength you should accept your defeat!

Better luck next time...
If there is any!

<B>Oops<B>, I hope I didn't go too harsh on you...
Well, now it's too late.

Goodbye, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>.
I'll build you a <Co=St7>Grave<RE> if you <B>promise<B> to stay dead...
