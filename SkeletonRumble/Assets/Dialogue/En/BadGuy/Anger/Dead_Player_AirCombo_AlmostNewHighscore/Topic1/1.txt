Ha!
I shut you down before you could complete your new <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>!
That's what you get for <B>NOT<B> concentrating on our fight!

Stop chasing after <Co=St4>Highscores<RE> in the middle of our fights!

And another attempt at cracking your <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE> has been prevented!
Seriously, focus on our fight a bit more!

You seriously attempted to complete a new <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>, didn't you?
Too bad I <Co=St6,B>Killed<RE> you before you could do it!

Since you're going for that sweet, sweet <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>, I decided to interfere a bit.
You're welcome!
