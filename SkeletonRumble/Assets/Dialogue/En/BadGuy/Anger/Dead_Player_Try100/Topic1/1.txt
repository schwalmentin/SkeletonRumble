I'm sorry but could you <B>stop<B> coming back?
The <Co=St3>100th <Co=St7>Grave<RE> is LAST one I'm going to build...
You're ruining the beautiful landscape with those <Co=St7>Graves<RE>...

<B,S=2>Stop<RE>!
I'm NOT going to build you any more <Co=St7>Graves<RE>...
The landscape is ruined, and you don't seem like you have the mental capacity to know when you should give up...

I told you... like so many times before, my advice was right, and you NEVER cared...
This means no more <Co=St7>Graves<RE> for you, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!

Well...
I DID warn you multiple times...
I'm going to build you <B>ONE<B> last <Co=St7>Grave<RE> now...

You never learned...
I think I finally lost my hope for you...
This will be the last <Co=St7>Grave<RE> I'm going to give you...
You better stay dead now.
