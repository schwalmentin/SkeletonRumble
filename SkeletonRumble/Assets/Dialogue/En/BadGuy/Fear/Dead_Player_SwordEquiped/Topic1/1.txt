Y-your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> definitively is sharp, b-but it can't hold up with my s-standards...

The b-blade of your <Co=St9>S-sword<RE> is very dull compared to mine...

I-I'm going to s-stick your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> into your <Co=St7>G-grave<RE> since it's n-no sutable f-for combat.

Y-you have just p-proven that your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> is not e-enough to <Co=St6>K-kill<RE> me.
Therefor I o-officially declare it a-as garbage!

T-to be honest it's a l-little wonder your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> isn't b-broken already since it is of a rather bad q-quality.
W-well, what can you d-do...
