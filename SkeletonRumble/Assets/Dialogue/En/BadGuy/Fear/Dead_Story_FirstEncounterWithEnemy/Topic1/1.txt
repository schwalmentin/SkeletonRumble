I t-told you...
I'm way too s-strong for you!

G-give up, <Co=St1>L-little One<RE>!
Now that y-you've seen my s-strength you should accept your d-defeat!

B-better luck next t-time...
If there is a-any!

I-I hope I didn't go too h-harsh on you...
W-well, now it's too l-late.

G-goodbye, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>.
I'll b-build you a <Co=St7>G-grave<RE> if you promise to stay d-dead...
