W-well...
I h-hope you weren't hoping f-for a g-grand climax because I'm j-just... <TD=0.5>baffled... <TD=0.7>and d-dead now!

You d-did great!
...
Got me on your f-first try...
... 
What are you s-still here f-for?

A-after all we've g-gone through!
Or rather n-nothing we've gone t-through...
I want to say...
I e-enjoyed every last minute of my l-life!
Farewell... <Co=St1>Little One<RE>...

A-after all we've g-gone through!
Or rather n-nothing we've gone t-through...
I want to say...
I hated every last minute of you chasing me!
Farewell... <Co=St1>Little One<RE>...

...
S-sooo...
What now?
T-there isn't anything else h-here...
You've d-done it!
You completed the c-campaign on your first t-try!
