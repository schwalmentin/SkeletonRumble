O-ok, ok but <Co=St3>50<RE> t-tries?
T-talking about s-stubbornness...

Y-yes, but shouldn't you r-rethink your approach a bit, after you f-failed <Co=St3>50<RE> t-times?

<Co=St3>50th<RE> t-time is the c-charm... r-right?

L-look, this is your <Co=St3>50th<RE> t-try and I don't a-appreciate you always coming back j-just to be <Co=St6>Killed<RE> a-again...

E-even if it is the <Co=St3>50th<RE> t-try nothing will m-magically change from before...
