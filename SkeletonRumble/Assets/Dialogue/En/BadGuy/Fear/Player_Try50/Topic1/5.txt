I g-guess we'll talk about this a-again once you t-try your <Co=St3>100th<RE> time.

Let's r-revisit this again when we c-crack your <Co=St3>100th<RE> t-try!

Maybe s-sometime in the future you will f-finally understand...
Until then, p-prepare to <Co=St6>D-die<RE>!

Let's at least p-party for this <Co=St3>A-anniversary<RE>.
I'll even i-invite <Co=St6>D-death<RE> to the t-table!

I w-won't even try to u-understand what's going on in your h-head...
