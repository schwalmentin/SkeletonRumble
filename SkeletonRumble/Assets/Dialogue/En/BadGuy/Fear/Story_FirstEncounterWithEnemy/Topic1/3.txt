A-again?
S-seriously?
When do you g-guys learn you can't d-defeat me?

F-firstly, that's not n-nice to do and secondly you s-shouldn't be a-able to defeat me anyway.

How b-bold of you to ask!
Not that it m-matters since I am t-to s-strong for you...

W-wow, you're jumping r-right to it... not that it m-matters since I am way s-stronger than you anyway...

I-I think <Co=St1>L-little One<RE> would be a great n-name for you...
You jump r-right to the point, p-probably have no b-brain and you're w-weaker than me...
It f-fits you p-perfectly!
