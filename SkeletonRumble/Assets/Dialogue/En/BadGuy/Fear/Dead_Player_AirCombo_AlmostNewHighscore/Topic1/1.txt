H-ha!
I s-shut you d-down before you could complete your new <Co=St4>A-air Combo H-highscore<RE>!
That's what you g-get for not c-concentrating on our fight!

Stop c-chasing after <Co=St4>Highscores<RE> in the m-middle of our fights!

And another attempt at c-cracking your <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE> has been p-pp... prevented!

You s-seriously attempted to c-complete a new <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>, d-didn't you?
T-too bad I <Co=St6>K-killed<RE> you before you could do it!

Since you're going for that s-sweet <Co=St4>Air Combo H-highscore<RE>, I t-tried to interfere a bit.
