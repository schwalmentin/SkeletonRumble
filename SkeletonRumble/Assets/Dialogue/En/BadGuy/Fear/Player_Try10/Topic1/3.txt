I h-have no clue by what a-ancient magic you keep c-coming back without f-feeling anything!

Is your b-brain mentally s-strong or are you just to d-dumb to feel anything?

I don't w-want to know what happened to you b-before all of this... b-but considering your willpower, it must have been a-awful!

Are you something like a d-demigod of <Co=St6>D-death<RE> or why do you k-keep coming back as if nothing h-happened?

I t-think you lost y-your brain, n-nervous system, hearth and e-everything else that has to do with e-emotions, pain and suffering.
W-why?
Because you're a-always coming back as if n-nothing happened...
