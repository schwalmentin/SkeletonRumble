I-it has got to be p-painful every t-time you <Co=St6>Die<RE>.
So why do you k-keep c-coming back?

Hey, <Co=St1>L-little One<RE>...
Isn't it p-painful to t-try?

Even t-though you are d-dead already, isn't it still p-painful to <Co=St6>Die<RE>?

I a-admire your will to l-live and the determination in your n-nonexistent heart, but it has got to h-hurt, d-doesn't it?

I would p-probably suffer from a t-trauma if I were you...
