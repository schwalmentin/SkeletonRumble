Y-your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> is b-blunt!
You p-probably can't even crack a <Co=St5>S-skull<RE> with it!
<FS=20>Hopefully...

Y-your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> looks really n-nice, but it is u-useless as a <Co=St9>W-weapon<RE>...

The b-balance is off, the h-head has seen its d-days and it seems like it's h-hollow inside...
H-how can you even fight with this <Co=St9>H-hammer<RE>?

Your <Co=St9>H-hammer<RE> is a n-nice piece of art b-but it shouldn't be used as a <Co=St9>Weapon<RE>...
Which i-is a p-problem since you f-fight with it...

I'm s-sorry but you'll never reach your full p-potential with this kind of <Co=St9>W-weapon<RE>...
