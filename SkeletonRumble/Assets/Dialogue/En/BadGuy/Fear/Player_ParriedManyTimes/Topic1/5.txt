S-shut up!
Don't d-diminish the worth of something s-someone is working for!

Every d-dream is worth having!

I should say the s-same about your w-wish to defeat me!

You'll never u-understand it with that k-kind of attitude!

You should s-start being a d-dreamer too.
It helps with k-keeping a good m-mindset!
