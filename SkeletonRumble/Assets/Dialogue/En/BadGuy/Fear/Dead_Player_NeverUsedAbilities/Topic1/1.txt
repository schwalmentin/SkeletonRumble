If you don't want to f-fight, I won't stop y-you from leaving!

I-I don't want to know what you wanted to a-achieve with this, b-but it didn't seem to work out...
<FS=20>...Which is great...

A-are you finally g-giving up?
<FS=20>Please say yes...

I-if you want to <Co=St6>D-die<RE>, then at least do it s-somewhere were I don't have to look into your eyes!
