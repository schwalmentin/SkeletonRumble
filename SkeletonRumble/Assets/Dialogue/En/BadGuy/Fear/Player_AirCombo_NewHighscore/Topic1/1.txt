The a-air is definitely r-refreshing but getting smacked through it m-makes me want to <Co=St6>K-kill<RE> you really bad!

I-if you keep smacking me through the a-air like that, then I'll crave for t-the p-power of flight more than ever before.

C-could... could you stop pushing me t-through the air. <FS=20>Please<RE>
It h-hurts and I can't seem to escape it that e-easily!

T-that was enough fresh a-air for me!
Would you be so k-kind to stop hurling me through the a-air?

Flying sure is n-nice but the pain sadly h-holds this experience away from being e-enjoyable...
