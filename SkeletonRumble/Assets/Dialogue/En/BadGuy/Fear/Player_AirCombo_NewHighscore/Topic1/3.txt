T-this new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> of yours i-is... well at least a l-little higher than before.

A-as if this already got to b-be your new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE>?
Your last o-one must have been really b-bad...

S-so, it has already b-been a new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE>?

Not bad, to be h-honest I didn't think that t-this <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> could be t-this high...
A-as if I would ever s-say that!
Too bad this <Co=St4>H-highscore<RE> is still w-worth nothing!

That's a p-pathetic little <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> y-you've got there.
There is n-nothing you could be p-proud about!
