But d-doesn't it... like... hurt to <Co=St6>D-die<RE>?

O-ok, ok!
But s-still, shouldn't this be at l-least... a bit w-worryful to you?

O-ok, I get it.
You are one of the e-extremely stubborn ones, but doesn't this t-take its toll on you?

W-why am I more w-worried about you than you y-yourself?
Do you e-even care about what's h-happening to you?

E-even though you are s-struggling you're not g-giving up...
W-why?
Why w-won't you take c-care of yourself?
