T-that's one of the stupidest r-reasons I have ever heard.

I-I don't get it.
You could use your t-time way better but you're j-just... <Co=St8>J-jumping<RE>...
Up and d-down and up and... d-down

S-sorry to say but s-stop.
Just s-stop.
Your reasoning is just d-dumb and nothing m-more...

I think I'm g-going to get i-infected with your s-stupidness if I listen to you any l-longer!

My head h-hurts from the sheer stupidness of y-your comments!
