O-oh my god, c-could you please s-stop <Co=St8>Jumping<RE>!
W-what are you?
A f-frog?

Why are you <Co=St8>J-jumping<RE> so often?
Is t-there any tactical v-value to it?

I w-wonder if you were still here if y-you <Co=St6>D-died<RE> as often as y-you <Co=St8>Jumped<RE>!

So, you've m-mutated into a s-spring now, haven't you?

C-come on my little g-grasshopper.
Let me s-step on you, to hear that e-excellent crunching sound of your <Co=St5>e-exoskeleton<RE>!
S-stop <Co=St8>Jumping<RE> away, w-what are you fleeing f-from?
