I-I think I lost my last s-shred of h-hope into you.

S-stop being so a-annoying please!

Don't w-worry, I don't think I was ever as d-disappointed as n-now...

It's a w-waste of time to h-hope for you to become less a-annoying...

H-how about this.
I am going to <Co=St8>J-jump<RE> as high as I can and t-then I'm going to c-crush the ego you've collected up t-there.
Sounds f-fair?
L-let's do it!
