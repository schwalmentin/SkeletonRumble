Phew!|That was c-close!
You were f-fighting b-better!

T-that was a g-good fight!
T-too bad you didn't make it in the end!

I was s-sweating so much this fight!
A-at least as much sweating as someone u-undead is able to!

Ouch!
I-it was way closer than I would have l-liked it!

J-Just b-because it got a bit c-close doesn't mean you've s-suddenly got the upper hand... <FS=20> right?
