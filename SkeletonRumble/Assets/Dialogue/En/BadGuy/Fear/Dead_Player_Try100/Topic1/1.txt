I-I'm s-sorry but could you s-stop coming back?
The <Co=St3>100th <Co=St7>G-grave<RE> is last one I'm going to b-build...
Y-you're ruining the beautiful l-landscape with t-those <Co=St7>G-graves<RE>...

S-stop!
I'm not going to b-build you any more <Co=St7>G-graves<RE>...
The l-landscape is ruined, and y-you don't seem like you have the m-mental capacity to know when you s-should give up...

I t-told you... like so many times before, my advice was r-right, and you never c-cared...
This means no m-more <Co=St7>Graves<RE> for you, <Co=St1>L-little One<RE>!

W-well...
I did warn you m-multiple times...
I'm going to b-build you one last <Co=St7>G-grave<RE> now...

You never l-learned...
I think I f-finally lost my h-hope for you...
This will be the last <Co=St7>G-grave<RE> I'm going to g-give you...
You better stay d-dead now.
