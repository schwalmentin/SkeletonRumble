E-even after t-trying your best to <Co=St8>P-parry<RE> everything... y-you still failed...

F-finally, I got some g-good hits on you!
Y-your tendency to <Co=St8>P-parry<RE> is really a-annoying!

Y-you seem to t-try to <Co=St8>Parry<RE> my a-attacks the whole time.
T-too bad your t-timing is not the b-best!

S-stop <Co=St8>Parrying<RE> my a-attacks!
It's a f-fine <Co=St8>Skill<RE> but it is also a-annoying as hell!

S-stop <Co=St8>Parrying<RE>!
It doesn't f-fit into your f-fight style when you can't r-reliably defend yourself with it!
