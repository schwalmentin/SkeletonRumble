W-what a w-waste of time...
You c-couldn't even hit me!

At least t-try to hit me next time!
<FS=20> ...please don't...

G-give up <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
Our c-current <Co=St8>Skill<RE> gap is just to h-high!
You d-didn't even land a single hit!

With t-those <Co=St8>Skills<RE> of yours, y-you're never going to h-hit me!

Y-you didn't even hit me o-once!
<FS=20>...L-lucky!
