S-stop going easy on me b-by not f-fighting properly!

You're n-not even t-trying to <Co=St8>D-dodge<RE> my attacks!

C-could you fight p-properly?
This is s-scraping my honor!

You haven't b-beaten me o-once, so why aren't you f-fighting properly?

You're horrible for t-treating me like as if I were a c-child...
