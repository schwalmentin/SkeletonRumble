<FS=20>Please?

It seems one of my <Co=St9>H-hammers<RE> has seen its b-best days...
H-hey, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
D-do you want to s-swap <Co=St9>H-hammers<RE>?

<Co=St1>L-little One<RE>!
I-I like the <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> you're using!
C-could you see y-yourself d-donating it to my personal collection?

T-that's a fine g-gravure on your <Co=St9>H-hammer<RE>...
C-could I have a c-closer look?

You've got a f-fine <Co=St9>Hammer<RE>...
