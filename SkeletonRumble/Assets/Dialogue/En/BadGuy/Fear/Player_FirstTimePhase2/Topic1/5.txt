Y-you've got guts to s-say that!

B-bring it on so that I can e-end your life as f-fast as possible!

I will e-end your life for t-this!

T-this is your last w-warning!
Flee as f-far as you can because I won't h-hold myself back any l-longer!

My last w-words have been set in s-stone for many years now...
And yet n-nobody has ever had the j-joy of hearing them... and this won't c-change for you!

You should n-never have come this f-far...
I will p-punish you with <Co=St6>D-death<RE>!
