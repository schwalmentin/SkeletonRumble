I s-should probably start f-fighting properly now, s-shouldn't I?

I-in that case...
Let's r-raise the c-challenge a bit...

Don't worry, I'm not m-mad...
I'm just g-going to make sure your n-next few <Co=St6>D-deaths<RE> will f-feel a bit more... p-painful!

A-as if I would be a-affected by your endless b-barrage of words!

You w-will be the only one to <Co=St6>D-die<RE> at this miserable p-place!

H-hah, do you r-really think I'm going to e-end this h-here?
N-no... your l-life will be the only t-thing that ends here!
