T-that's a s-sharp <Co=St9>Sword<RE> you've got t-there!
Would you mind s-showing it to me?

I'm wondering whose <Co=St9>S-sword<RE> is s-sharper.
Mine o-or yours?

That's a nice b-blade you've got there, <Co=St1>L-little One<RE>!
I wonder how s-sharp it is?

That's a p-pointy tip and a c-clean blade you've got there.
Do you m-mind showing its s-sharpness to me?

That <Co=St9>S-sword<RE> looks just as unpractical a-as mine...
Would mind s-showing me if it's at least s-sharp?
