C-could you prove it w-without having to harm me?

It w-would be nice to e-experience it without <Co=St6>D-dying<RE> in the process.

H-hold on! I-is there any option without g-getting <Co=St6>Killed<RE>?

T-to be h-honest, they all sound like t-they hurt a bit too much for my t-taste...
Is it p-possible to tone it down a b-bit?

You sound like the b-biggest sadist I've ever met...
C-could you... <TD=0.5>not <Co=St6>K-kill<RE> me... maybe?
