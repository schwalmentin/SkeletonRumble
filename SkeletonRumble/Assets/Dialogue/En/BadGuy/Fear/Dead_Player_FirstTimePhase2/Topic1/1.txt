S-sorry, but I had to make q-quick work of you!

D-don't you want to g-give up, after you've seen my full s-strength?

I-it was q-quite refreshing sending you to your <Co=St7>G-grave<RE>!

N-now you should know of your own w-weakness!
So l-leave me alone already!

T-this is my t-true strength!
Y-you should accept your defeat... <FS=20>and not seek revenge, please...
