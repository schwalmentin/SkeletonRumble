<Co=St3>50 <Co=St7>Graves<RE> and not a single visitor besides me when I build your next one...
How sad!

There is no better way than to celebrate your <Co=St3>Anniversary <Co=St6>Death<RE> with a new <Co=St7>Grave<RE>...

Didn't I tell you that it's getting ridiculous?
Because it is!

Do you think you can make it until our <Co=St3>100th Anniversary<RE>?
Because I think you won't...

Even after <Co=St3>50<RE> tries you still don't get the difference in strength between us...
