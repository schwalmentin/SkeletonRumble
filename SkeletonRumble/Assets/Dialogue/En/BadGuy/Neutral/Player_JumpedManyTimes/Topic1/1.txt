Oh my god, could you please stop <Co=St8>Jumping<RE>!
What are you?
A frog?

Why are you <Co=St8>Jumping<RE> so often?
Is there any tactical value to it?

I wonder if you were still here if you <Co=St6>Died<RE> as often as you <Co=St8>Jumped<RE>!

So, you've mutated into a spring now, haven't you?

Come on my little grasshopper.
Let me step on you, to hear that excellent crunching sound of your <Co=St5>exoskeleton<RE>!
Stop <Co=St8>Jumping<RE> away, what are you fleeing from?
