I think I lost my last shred of hope into you.

Stop being so annoying please!

Don't worry, I don't think I was ever as disappointed as now...

It's a waste of time to hope for you to become less annoying...

How about this.
I am going to <Co=St8>Jump<RE> as high as I can and then I'm going to crush the ego you've collected up there.
Sounds fair?
Let's do it!
