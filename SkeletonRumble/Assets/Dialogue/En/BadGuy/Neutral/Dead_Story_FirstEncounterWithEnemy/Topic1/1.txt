I told you...
I'm way too strong for you!

Give up, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
Now that you've seen my strength you should accept your defeat!

Better luck next time...
If there is any!

Oops, I hope I didn't go too harsh on you...
Well, now it's too late.

Goodbye, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>.
I'll build you a <Co=St7>Grave<RE> if you promise to stay dead...
