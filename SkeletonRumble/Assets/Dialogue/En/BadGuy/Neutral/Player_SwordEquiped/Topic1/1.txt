That's a sharp <Co=St9>Sword<RE> you've got there!
Would you mind showing it to me?

I'm wondering whose <Co=St9>Sword<RE> is sharper.
Mine or yours?

That's a nice blade you've got there, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
I wonder how sharp it is?

That's a pointy tip and a clean blade you've got there.
Do you mind showing its sharpness to me?

That <Co=St9>Sword<RE> looks just as unpractical as mine...
Would mind showing me if it's at least sharp?
