Could you prove it without having to harm me?

It would be nice to experience it without <Co=St6>Dying<RE> in the process.

Hold on! Is there any option without getting <Co=St6>Killed<RE>?

To be honest, they all sound like they hurt a bit too much for my taste...
Is it possible to tone it down a bit?

You sound like the biggest sadist I've ever met...
Could you... <TD=0.5>not <Co=St6>Kill<RE> me... maybe?
