Ok, ok but <Co=St3>50<RE> tries?
Talking about stubbornness...

Yes, but shouldn't you rethink your approach a bit, after you failed <Co=St3>50<RE> times?

<Co=St3>50th<RE> time is the charm, right?

Look, this is your <Co=St3>50th<RE> try and I don't appreciate you always coming back just to be <Co=St6>Killed<RE> again...

Even if it is the <Co=St3>50th<RE> try nothing will magically change from before...
