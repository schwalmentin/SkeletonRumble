Your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> is way too blunt!
You probably can't even crack a <Co=St5>Skull<RE> with it!

Your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> looks really nice, but it sadly is absolutely useless as a <Co=St9>Weapon<RE>...

The balance is off, the head has seen its days and it seems like it's hollow inside...
How can you even fight with this <Co=St9>Hammer<RE>?

Your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> is a wonderful piece of art but it doesn't work as a <Co=St9>Weapon<RE>...
Which is a problem since you should fight with it...

I'm sorry but you'll never reach your full potential with this kind of <Co=St9>Weapon<RE>...
