I tried... I tried.
Back to teaching you the hard way then!

Ugh!
Why did I even bother counting if you won't listen...

Even when you say so...
I still defeated you a <Co=St3>100<RE> times!
So, one more fight won't make a difference!

Those who refuse to follow rules shall feel the consequences...

You're as calm as ever...
Let's handle this with a good old fight then...
