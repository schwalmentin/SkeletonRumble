The air is definitely refreshing but getting smacked through it makes me want to <Co=St6>Kill<RE> you really bad!

If you keep smacking me through the air like that, then I'll crave for the power of flight more than ever before.

Could you stop pushing me through the air.
It hurts and I can't seem to escape it that easily!

That was enough fresh air for me!
Would you be so kind to stop hurling me through the air?

Flying sure is nice but the pain sadly holds this experience away from being enjoyable...
