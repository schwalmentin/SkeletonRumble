Did you even try to fight back seriously?

You've got what you deserve for not taking this seriously!

I don't want to know what you wanted to achieve with this, but it didn't seem to work out well...

Are you finally giving up? At least that's the only real explanation for your lack in initiative...

If you just want to <Co=St6>Die<RE>, then at least do it somewhere were I don't have to look into your dead eyes!
