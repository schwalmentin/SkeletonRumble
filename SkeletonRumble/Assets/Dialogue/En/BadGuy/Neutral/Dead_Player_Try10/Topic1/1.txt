You should be proficiently powered out now, so stop returning for once...

Do you like the <Co=St7>Graves<RE>?
Because now you're getting your <Co=St3>10th<RE> one...

Aren't you tired of <Co=St6>Dying<RE> already?

You should know by now that you can't compete with me.
So, stop coming back already!

Stay dead for once...
Please!
