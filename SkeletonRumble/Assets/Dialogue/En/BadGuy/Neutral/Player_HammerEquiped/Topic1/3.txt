Okay, okay!
Asking doesn't hurt!
I still kind of want it...

You could have at least considered it...

In that case I might as well just take it from you!

Come on, I wanted to get it without having your blood all over it...
Even if though you can't bleed anymore...

Is it the please?
Is that the problem?
Could you give it to me please?
