It has got to be painful every time you <Co=St6>Die<RE>.
So why do you keep coming back?

Hey, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>...
Isn't it painful to try?

Even though you are dead already, isn't it still painful to <Co=St6>Die<RE>?

I admire your will to live and the determination in your nonexistent heart, but it has got to hurt, doesn't it?

I would probably suffer from a trauma if I were you...
