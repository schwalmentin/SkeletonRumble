Sorry, but I had to make quick work of you to set an example!

Don't you want to give up, after you've seen my full strength?

It was quite refreshing sending you to your <Co=St7>Grave<RE> with my full strength!

Now you should know of your own weakness!
Give up already.
You have no chance!

This is my true strength!
You should accept your defeat after you've been crushed this hard...
