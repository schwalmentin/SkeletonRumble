I have no clue by what <W>ancient magic you keep coming back<W> without feeling anything!

Is your <W>brain mentally strong<W> or are you just <W>to dumb<W> to feel anything?

I don't want to know what happened to you before all of this but considering your <W>willpower<W>, it must have been awful!

Are you something like a <W>demigod of <Co=St6>Death<RE> or why do you keep coming back as if nothing happened?

I think you lost your <W>brain, nervous system, hearth<W> and everything else that has to do with <W>emotions, pain and suffering.
<W>Why?
Because you're always coming back as if nothing happened...
