I think <W>I never wanted to <Co=St6>Kill<RE> you as much as now!

<W>I have never heard such a dumb reason!

There goes my hope for you once again...

Now I'm certain!
<W>You truly have lost your brain and everything that comes with it!

Do me a favor and dig yourself a <Co=St7>Grave<RE>...
<W>You'll need it!
