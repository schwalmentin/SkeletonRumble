It has got to be painful every time you <Co=St6>Die<RE>.
So <W>why do you keep coming back?

Hey, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>...
<W>Isn't it painful to try?

Even though you are dead already, <W>isn't it still painful to <Co=St6>Die<RE>?

<W>I admire your will to live and the determination in your nonexistent heart,<W> but it has got to hurt, doesn't it?

I would probably <W>suffer from a trauma<W> if I were you...
