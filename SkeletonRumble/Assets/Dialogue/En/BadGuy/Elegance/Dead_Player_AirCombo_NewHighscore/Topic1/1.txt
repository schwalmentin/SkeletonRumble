<W>Congratulations on your new <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>...
<W>Let's celebrate it<W> with your <Co=St6>Death<RE>!

Too bad this nice <Co=St4>Air Combo<RE> of yours didn't go anywhere...
<W>At least it's a new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE>!

<W>The new <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE> <W>surely gives you bragging rights<W>, but it doesn't help you when you still <Co=St6>Die<RE>!

<W>You've made it!<W> At least you've got a new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE>!
Apart from that defeating me still seems to be out of reach for you...

That great <Co=St4>Air Combo<RE> was... great?
Still, <W>you should focus on <Co=St8>Skills<RE> <W>to defeat me<W> instead of breaking your <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> if you ever want to get out of this repeated fighting hell!
