You should be proficiently powered out now, so <W>stop returning for once...

Do you like the <Co=St7>Graves<RE>?
<W>Because now you're getting your <Co=St3>10th<RE> one...

<W>Aren't you tired of <Co=St6>Dying<RE> already?

<W>You should know by now that you can't compete with me.
So, stop coming back already!

Stay dead for once...
<W>Please!
