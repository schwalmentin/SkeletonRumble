Even after trying your best to <Co=St8>Parry<RE> everything you still failed...
<W>What a shame...

<W>Finally, I got some good hits on you!
Your tendency to <Co=St8>Parry<RE> is really annoying!

You seem to try to <W,Co=St8>Parry<RE> <W>my attacks<W> the whole time.
Too bad your timing is not the best!

Stop <Co=St8>Parrying<RE> my attacks!
<W>It's a fine <Co=St8>Skill<RE> but it is also annoying as hell!

<W>Stop <Co=St8>Parrying<RE>!
It doesn't fit into your fight style when you can't reliably defend yourself with it!
