That's a <W>sharp <Co=St9>Sword<RE> you've got there!
Would you mind showing it to me?

I'm wondering whose <W,Co=St9>Sword<RE> <W>is sharper.
<W>Mine or yours?

That's a nice blade you've got there, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
<W>I wonder how sharp it is?

That's a <W>pointy tip and a clean blade<W> you've got there.
Do you mind showing its sharpness to me?

That <Co=St9>Sword<RE> looks just as unpractical as mine...
<W>Would mind showing me if it's at least sharp?
