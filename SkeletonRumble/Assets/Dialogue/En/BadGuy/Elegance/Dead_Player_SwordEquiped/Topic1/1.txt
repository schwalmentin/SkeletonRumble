Your <W,Co=St9>Sword<RE> <W>definitively is sharp<W>, but it can't hold up with my standards...

The <W>blade of your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> is very dull compared to mine...
A typical waste product.

I'm going to stick your <W,Co=St9>Sword<RE> <W>into your <Co=St7>Grave<RE>.
It's not like it could be used...

You have just <W>proven that your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> <W>is not enough to <Co=St6>Kill<RE> <W>me.
Therefor I officially declare it as garbage!

To be honest <W>it's a little wonder your <Co=St9>Sword<RE> <W>isn't broken already<W> since it is of a rather bad quality.
Well, <W>what can you do...
