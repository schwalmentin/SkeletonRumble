Ha!
I <W>shut you down<W> before you could complete your new <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>!
<W>That's what you get for not concentrating on our fight!

<W>Stop chasing after <Co=St4>Highscores<RE> in the middle of our fights!

And another attempt at cracking your <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE> has been prevented!
Seriously, <W>focus on our fight a bit more!

You seriously attempted to <W>complete a new <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>, didn't you?
Too bad I <Co=St6>Killed<RE> you before you could do it!

Since you're going for that sweet, sweet <Co=St4>Air Combo Highscore<RE>, I decided to interfere a bit.
<W>You're welcome!
