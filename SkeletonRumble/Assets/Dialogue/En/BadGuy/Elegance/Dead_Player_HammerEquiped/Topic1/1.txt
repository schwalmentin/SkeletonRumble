Your <Co=St9>Hammer<RE> is way too blunt!
You probably can't even <W>crack a <Co=St5>Skull<RE> with it!

Your <W,Co=St9>Hammer<RE> <W>looks really nice<W>, but it sadly is absolutely useless as a <Co=St9>Weapon<RE>...

The balance is off, the head has seen its days and it seems like it's hollow inside...
How can you even fight with this <Co=St9>Hammer<RE>?

Your <W,Co=St9>Hammer<RE> <W>is a wonderful piece of art<W> but it doesn't work as a <Co=St9>Weapon<RE>...
Which is a problem since you should fight with it...

I'm sorry but you'll <W>never reach your full potential<W> with this kind of <Co=St9>Weapon<RE>...
