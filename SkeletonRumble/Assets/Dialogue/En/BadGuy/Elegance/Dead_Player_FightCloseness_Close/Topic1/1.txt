Phew!|That was a close one!
<W>You were fighting better than ever!

<W>That was a good fight!
Too bad you didn't make it in the end!

<W>I was sweating this fight!
Well, at least as much sweating as someone undead is able to!

Ouch!
<W>It got to be closer than I would like<W> but this was nothing more than a little slip up!

Just because it got a bit close doesn't mean you've suddenly got the upper hand, <W,Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
