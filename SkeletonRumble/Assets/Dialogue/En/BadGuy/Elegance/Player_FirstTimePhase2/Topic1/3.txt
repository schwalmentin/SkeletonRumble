I should probably <W>start fighting properly<W> now, shouldn't I?

In that case...
<W>Let's raise the challenge a bit...

Don't worry, <W>I'm not mad...
I'm just going to make sure your next few <Co=St6>Deaths<RE> will feel a bit more... <W>painful!

As if I would be affected by your <W>endless barrage of words!

You will be the only one to <Co=St6>Die<RE> at this miserable place!

Hah, do you really think I'm going to <W>end this here?
<W>No...<TD=0.5> your life will be the only thing that ends here!
