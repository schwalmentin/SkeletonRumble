<W>You've got guts<W> to say that!

Bring it on so that I can <W>end your life<W> as fast as possible!

I will <W>end your life<W> for this!

This is your last warning!
<W>Flee as far as you can<W> because I won't hold myself back any longer!

<W>My last words have been set in stone for many years now...
And yet nobody has ever had the joy of hearing them... <W>and this won't change for you!

You should never have come this far...
<W>I will punish you with <Co=St6>Death<RE>!
