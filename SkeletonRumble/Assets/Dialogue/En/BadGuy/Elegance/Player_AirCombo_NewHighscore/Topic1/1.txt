The <W>air is definitely refreshing<W> but getting smacked through it makes me want to <Co=St6>Kill<RE> you really bad!

If you keep smacking me through the air like that, then <W>I'll crave for the power of flight more than ever before.

<W>Could you stop pushing me through the air?
It hurts and I can't seem to escape it that easily!

That was enough fresh air for me!
<W>Would you be so kind to stop hurling me through the air?

<W>Flying sure is nice<W> but the pain sadly holds this experience away from <W>being enjoyable...
