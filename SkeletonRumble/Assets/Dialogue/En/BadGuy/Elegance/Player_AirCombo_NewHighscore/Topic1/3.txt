This new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> of yours is... well at least a little higher than before.

As if this already got to be your new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE>?
Your last one must have been really bad...

So, it has already been a new <Co=St4>Highscore<RE>?

Not bad, to be honest I didn't think that this <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> could be this high...
As if I would ever say that!
Too bad this <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> is still worth nothing!

That's a pathetic little <Co=St4>Highscore<RE> you've got there.
There is nothing you could be proud about!
