Well...
I hope you weren't hoping for a <W>grand climax<W> because I'm just... <TD=0.5>baffled... <TD=0.7,W>and dead now!

<W>You did great!
...
<W>Got me on your first try...
... 
What are you still here for?

<W>After all we've gone through!
Or rather nothing we've gone through...
I want to say...
<W>I enjoyed every last minute of our fight!
<W>Farewell, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!

<W>After all we've gone through!
Or rather nothing we've gone through...
I want to say...
I hated every last minute of our fight!
<W>Farewell, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!

...
Sooo...
What now?
There isn't anything else here...
<W>You've done it!
<W>You completed the campaign on your first try!
