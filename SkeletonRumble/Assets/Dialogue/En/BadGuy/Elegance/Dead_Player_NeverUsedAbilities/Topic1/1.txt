Did you even <W>try to fight back<W> seriously?

You've got what you deserve for <W>not taking this seriously!

I don't want to know what you <W>wanted to achieve<W> with this, but it didn't seem to work out well...

<W>Are you finally giving up?<W> At least that's the only real explanation for your lack in initiative...

If you just want to <Co=St6>Die<RE>, then at least <W>do it somewhere were I don't have to look into your dead eyes!
