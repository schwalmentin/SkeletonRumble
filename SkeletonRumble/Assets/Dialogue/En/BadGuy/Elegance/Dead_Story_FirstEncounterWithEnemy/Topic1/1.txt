I told you...
<W>I'm way too strong for you!

Give up, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>!
Now that you've <W>seen my strength<W> you should accept your defeat!

<W>Better luck next time...
If there is any!

<W>Oops, I hope I didn't go too harsh on you...
Well, now it's too late.

<W>Goodbye, <Co=St1>Little One<RE>.
I'll build you a <Co=St7>Grave<RE> if you promise to stay dead...
