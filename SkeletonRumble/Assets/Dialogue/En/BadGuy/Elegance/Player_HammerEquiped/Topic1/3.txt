Okay, okay!
<W>Asking doesn't hurt!
I still kind of want it...

<W>You could have at least considered it...

In that case I might as well <W>just take it from you!

Come on, I wanted to get it without having your <W>blood<W> all over it...
Even if though you can't <W>bleed<W> anymore...

Is it the please?
Is that the problem?
<W>Could you give it to me please?
