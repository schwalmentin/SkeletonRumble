Ok, ok but <Co=St3>50<RE> tries?
<W>Talking about stubbornness...

Yes, but shouldn't you <W>rethink your approach<W> a bit, after you failed <Co=St3>50<RE> times?

<W,Co=St3>50th<RE> <W>time is the charm,<W> right?

Look, this is your <W,Co=St3>50th<RE> <W>try<W> and I don't appreciate you always coming back just to be <W,Co=St6>Killed<RE> again...

Even if it is the <Co=St3>50th<RE> try <W>nothing will magically change<W> from before...
