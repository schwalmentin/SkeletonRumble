Sorry, but <W>I had to make quick work of you<W> to set an example!

Don't you want to give up, after you've seen <W>my full strength<W>?

It was quite refreshing sending you to your <Co=St7>Grave<RE> with <W>my full strength<W>!

<W>Now you should know of your own weakness!
Give up already.
You have no chance!

<W>This is my true strength!
You should accept your defeat after you've been crushed this hard...
