I think I lost my last <W>shred of hope<W> into you.

<W>Stop being so annoying please!

Don't worry, I don't think I was ever as <W>disappointed as now...

It's a waste of time to hope for you to become less <W>annoying...

How about this.
I am going to <Co=St8>Jump<RE> as high as I can and then I'm going to <W>crush the ego<W> you've collected up there.
<W>Sounds fair?
<W>Let's do it!
