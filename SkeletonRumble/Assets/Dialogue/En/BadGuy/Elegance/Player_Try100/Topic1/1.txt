I am impressed!
<W>No really, this should be the <Co=St3>100th<RE> <W>time you are trying to defeat me!
If I counted correct...
I wonder, <W>why haven't you given up yet?

Come on... If I counted correct this will be the <Co=St3>100th<RE> time you are trying to defeat me.
I know you are somewhat stubborn but <W>why are you doing this to yourself?

<W>Congratulations!
This should be the <Co=St3>100th<RE> time you managed to come back after being defeated by me!

Oh my god!
<W>This has been our <Co=St3>99th<RE> <W>time fighting!
No wait...
The <W,Co=St3>100th<RE>...
It has been our <Co=St3>100th<RE> fight and you still won't give up?

<W>Welcome to the legendary <Co=St3>100th<RE> <W>fight!
In the right corner is the undefeated champion <W,Co=St5>“SKELETON_1”<RE>!
And in the left corner his opponent <W,Co=St1>“TheWeakLittleOne”<RE> will be <W>crushed again<W>!
<W>Let's ask him together!!!
Why are you still insisting on going on?
