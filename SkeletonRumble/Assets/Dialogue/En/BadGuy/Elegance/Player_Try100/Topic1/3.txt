<W>But doesn't it...<W> like... hurt to <Co=St6>Die<RE>?

Ok, ok!
But still, shouldn't this be at least... <W>a bit worryful to you?

Ok, I get it.
You are one of the <W>extremely stubborn ones<W>, but doesn't this <W>take its toll<W> on you?

Why am I more worried about you than you yourself?
<W>Do you even care about what's happening to you?

Even though you are struggling you're not giving up...
<W>Why?
<W>Why won't you take care of yourself?
