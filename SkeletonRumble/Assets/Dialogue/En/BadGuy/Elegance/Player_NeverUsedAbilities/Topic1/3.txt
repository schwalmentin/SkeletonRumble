<W>Stop going easy on me<W> by not fighting properly!

You're not even trying to <W,Co=St8>Dodge<RE> <W>my attacks!

Could you fight properly?
<W>This is scraping my honor!

You haven't beaten me once, so <W>why aren't you fighting properly?

<W>You're horrible<W> for treating me like as if I were a child...
