Well, the fall damage seemed to do the trick...
<W>Rest in peace little frog!

Your <Co=St8>Jumping<RE> strategy didn't seem to help you either...
<W>You should rethink your approach a bit!

<Co=St8>Jumping<RE> really <W>drains your internal stamina<W>, doesn't it?
And when you're getting tired, you're bound to make mistakes!

If you could <W>fight as good as you jump<W> than I wouldn't have had to dig all of those <Co=St7>Graves<RE> for you...

A small advice for you <Co=St1>Little One<RE>...
<W>The air is a great place to hinder someone's attack capabilities!
It is also the place where you can fall the furthest...
Do with this as you please!
